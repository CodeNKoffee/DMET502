## A True Story of Desperation, Schengen Expiry, and a 13:15 Arrival

## 🎯 The True Story Behind This Game

### The Desperate Situation

On **June 25th, 2025**, my teammate and I found ourselves in a nightmare scenario:

- **Flight**: CLJ → MUC → FRA → CAI (connecting through Munich and Frankfurt to Cairo)
- **Boarding closes**: 13:15 sharp
- **Our arrival**: 13:15 exactly (not a minute earlier)
- **Critical issue**: Our Schengen visas expired the next day (June 26th)
- **Consequence**: If we missed this flight, we'd need to renew Schengen visas AND book entirely new flights
- **Luggage problem**: We had massive luggage that needed special approval to bypass normal security

### The Real Airport Rush

This game recreates our actual experience:

1. **Rushing through security** with oversized luggage
2. **Getting manager approval** to bypass normal procedures
3. **Finding my teammate** who was lost in the chaos
4. **Reaching Gate A01** just as boarding was closing
5. **Making the 13:45 takeoff** by the skin of our teeth

## 🎯 The Real Story Continues...

This game captures the most stressful 30 minutes of our lives. We arrived at Cluj-Napoca Airport at exactly 13:15 - the same time boarding was closing. With our Schengen visas expiring the next day, missing this flight would have meant:

1. **Renewing Schengen visas** (expensive and time-consuming)
2. **Booking entirely new flights** (CLJ→MUC→FRA→CAI)
3. **Losing all our money** on the original tickets

The game's mechanics reflect our real experience:

- **Rushing through security** with oversized luggage
- **Getting manager approval** to bypass normal procedures  
- **Finding my teammate** who was lost in the chaos
- **Reaching Gate A01** just in time for the 13:45 takeoff

**We made it.** The plane took off at 13:45, and we caught our connecting flights to Munich, Frankfurt, and finally Cairo. This game is a tribute to that desperate, successful airport rush.
